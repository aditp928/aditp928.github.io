	 <u>A brief history about myself</u> <br> I was born in Mumbai,India. Shortly after, I moved to Florida where I grew up in the city of Lake Mary. 
		After graduating high school, I moved to Tampa, Florida where I attended the University of South Florida.
		During my time at the University of South Florida, I pursued a B.S Degree in Environmental Science and Policy as well as a M.A degree in Global Sustainability. I concentrated in Water and Energy management during my masters program.
		Post-graduation I accepted a job with an environmental consulting firm. Down the line I hope to pivot into the wonderful technology industry and become a full-stack web developer.
		</p>

		<p>In my free time, my hobbies include watching sports, reading, playing tennis, and coding! My favorite sport to watch is basketball. Go Magic!
		 Additionaly I love to watch movies and cook.</p>
